# PembroiderDemo
Demo of Pembroider variations and physical output.

### Details
This project uses Processing + PEmbroider to create a .pes file that you can use to embroider graphics.

### Setup
1. Go follow the setup instructions for PEmbroider here: https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider
For me, the automatic install didn't work. I downloaded the .zip file for PEmbroider and added it to my Processing libraries manually.
2. Create a new sketch (script) in Processing and save it. It will create a folder in your Processing sketchbook, wherever that is on your file system.
3. Drag whatever SVG you'd like to embroider into that folder.
4. Copy/paste the area_shirt_embroidery.pde script into Processing and alter it to use your SVG, and whatever settings / graphics you want. A photograph of the physical output of the current script is included in this repo.
